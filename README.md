# ChewC


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

In short, this will be a GPU-enabled stochastic simulation for breeding
programs with an emphasis on cost-benefit-analysis for novel breeding
tools and creating a suitable interface for RL agents.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will also incorporate an emphasis on budget and costs associated with
each action to manage long-term breeding budgets. As well as model
theoretical tools in the plant breederâ€™s toolbox. e.g.

> a treatment which increases crossover rates

> a treatment which reduces flowering time

> a treatment which enables gene drive at select loci

Each treatment will cost \$\$ ultimately helping guide the
implementation in real-world breeding programs.

## Install

``` sh
pip install chewc
```

## How to use

First, define the genome of your crop

``` python
import torch
```

``` python
g = Genome()
founder_pop = Population()
founder_pop.create_random_founder_population(g, 30)
# multi_traits
target_means = torch.tensor([0, 5, 20])
target_vars = torch.tensor([1, 1, 0.5])  # Note: I'm assuming you want a variance of 1 for the second trait
correlation_values = [
        [1.0, 0.2, 0.58],
        [0.2, 1.0, -0.37],
        [0.58, -0.37, 1.0],
    ]
traits = corr_traits(g, founder_pop.get_dosages().float(), target_means, target_vars, correlation_values)
```

    Created genetic map

``` python
f1 = x_random(g, founder_pop.get_genotypes().float(), 50) 
f1.shape
```

    torch.Size([50, 2, 10, 5])

``` python
DH = x_DH(g,f1)
```

``` python
DH.shape
```

    torch.Size([50, 2, 10, 5])
