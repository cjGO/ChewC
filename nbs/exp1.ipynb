    "DRL Agent's Action: The agent's action is not to choose a new selection percentage outright, but rather to adjust the existing selection intensity. It would output a value that represents a change to the current 20%.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "An action of +5 would increase the selection intensity to 25%.\n",
    "An action of -3 would decrease it to 17%.\n",
    "Bounded Action Space: We would define a range for these adjustments to keep the action space manageable and prevent extreme selections. For instance, the agent might only be able to adjust the selection intensity within Â±10% of the initial value.\n"
